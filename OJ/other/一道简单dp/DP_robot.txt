A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m*n grid.
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. 
There is a positive integer in each small grid which means the score that the robot get when it passes this grid.
Now you need to calculate the top k total score when the robot reach the destination.

note: The top k total score may contain same total score got from different paths.

Example 1:

Input:
3 3
2
3 2 5
3 2 2
4 2 1

Output:
13 13

Example 2:

Input:
4 4
3
7 1 5 8
4 6 2 1
4 2 1 3
5 7 3 2

Output:
32 31 29



TEST 1: 1 <= n, m <= 4, k = 1
TEST 2-3: 1<= n, m, k<=4
TEST 4: 1<= n, m <= 100, k = 1
TEST 5-10: 1<=n, m, k<=100

For all, cost <= 100
